This project is configured for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

#### Setup Instructions:

1. **Push to GitHub**: Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. **Enable Pages**: Go to your repository settings â†’ Pages â†’ Source â†’ "GitHub Actions"
3. **Configure Repository**: Update the repository URLs in `package.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "repository": {
       "type": "git",
       "url": "https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-test3.git"
     },
     "homepage": "https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/ai-test3/"
   }
   ```
4. **Update Base Path**: The Vite config is already set up to use the correct base path for GitHub Pages

## Game Mechanics

**Why `global.d.ts` instead of `compilerOptions.types` inside `jsconfig.json` or `tsconfig.json`?**

Setting `compilerOptions.types` shuts out all other types not explicitly listed in the configuration. Using triple-slash references keeps the default TypeScript setting of accepting type information from the entire workspace, while also adding `svelte` and `vite/client` type information.

**Why include `.vscode/extensions.json`?**

Other templates indirectly recommend extensions via the README, but this file allows VS Code to prompt the user to install the recommended extension upon opening the project.

**Why enable `checkJs` in the JS template?**

It is likely that most cases of changing variable types in runtime are likely to be accidental, rather than deliberate. This provides advanced typechecking out of the box. Should you like to take advantage of the dynamically-typed nature of JavaScript, it is trivial to change the configuration.

**Why is HMR not preserving my local component state?**

HMR state preservation comes with a number of gotchas! It has been disabled by default in both `svelte-hmr` and `@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte` due to its often surprising behavior. You can read the details [here](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-hmr/tree/master/packages/svelte-hmr#preservation-of-local-state).

If you have state that's important to retain within a component, consider creating an external store which would not be replaced by HMR.

```js
// store.js
// An extremely simple external store
import { writable } from 'svelte/store'
export default writable(0)
```
